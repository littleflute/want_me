"I'd Love You To Want Me"   By Lobo (1972)

When I saw you standing there
I bout fell out my chair
And when you moved your mouth to speak
I felt the blood go to my feet.

Now it took time for me to know
what you tried so not to show
Now something in my soul just cries
I see the want in your blue eyes.

Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be.

You told yourself years ago
You'd never let your feeling show
The obligation that you made
For the title that they gave.
