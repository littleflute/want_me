## "I'd Love You To Want Me" Â  By Lobo (1972)<br>
When I saw you standing there<br>
I bout fell out my chair<br>
And when you moved your mouth to speak<br>
I felt the blood go to my feet.<br>

Now it took time for me to know<br>
what you tried so not to show<br>
Now something in my soul just cries<br>
I see the want in your blue eyes.<br>

Baby, I'd love you to want me<br>
The way that I want you<br>
The way that it should be<br>
Baby, you'd love me to want you<br>
The way that I want to<br>
If you'd only let it be.<br>

You told yourself years ago<br>
You'd never let your feeling show<br>
The obligation that you made<br>
For the title that they gave.<br>
